      <p>I am very fond of storytelling. My ideal job involves weaving stories of dream and fact that
        express what people love and are proud of most about themselves. And that's what I do.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, but I learned what it feels like to starve, study, and
        spend your first paycheck at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I primarily worked with digital
        wind tunnel simulations for sports cars, varied criticism of contemporary media, and terrible student films. Mostly
        terrible student films.</p>
      <p>For two years, I worked in New York at a now-closed Japanese coffeehouse, a prestigious
        film production company, and a photography studio. I spent the time taking classes at NYU and learning graphic design from scratch. I ate
        a donut beside Maggie Gyllenhaal once.</p>
      <p>Now, I am the Creative Director at Aliento de Vida Ministries, a mid-sized church in the heart of Dallas where I grew up. 
        By day, I spend every hour weaving into digital film, image, and audio the stories and designs that mean the most to the people I love. By night, I do the same for you, my new client.</p>
      <p>So, let's talk about your story.</p>
